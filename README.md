# Deep Image Generation: StyleGAN3 vs DDPM

This project explores state-of-the-art deep generative models for image synthesis. Specifically, we compare:

- **StyleGAN3** (by NVIDIA)  
- **DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)**

The goal is to evaluate image generation quality across different architectures and datasets.
